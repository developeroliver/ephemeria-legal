  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last Updated: June 24, 2025</p>
  <p><em>How we protect your information</em></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Ephemeria. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information while using our app. We are committed to safeguarding your data and ensuring transparency about how your information is handled.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Authentication via Firebase</h2>
    <p>Ephemeria uses Firebase Authentication via Apple Sign in to allow users to securely sign in and access personalized features.</p>
    <p><strong>What We Collect via Firebase:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used solely for app functionality, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allowing you to log in securely</li>
      <li>Storing and syncing your content across devices</li>
      <li>Enabling sharing features and user-linked content uploads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your name or email for advertising purposes, and this data is never shared with third parties for marketing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Subscription & Purchase Management via RevenueCat</h2>
    <p>Ephemeria uses RevenueCat to provide subscriptions, ensuring a seamless and secure experience.</p>
    <p><strong>What RevenueCat Collects on Our Behalf:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A randomly generated anonymous user ID</li>
      <li>Transaction details (e.g., purchase date, product ID, subscription status, renewal info)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enable and manage premium features</li>
      <li>Prevent fraud through receipt validation</li>
      <li>Generate aggregated analytics to help us improve the app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Importantly, RevenueCat does not receive your Firebase username or email. The RevenueCat user ID is anonymous and not linked to your personal identity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p><strong>Firebase:</strong> For authentication.</p>
    <p><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For managing subscriptions, enabling entitlements, validating purchases, and analyzing aggregated subscription behavior.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Store Your Data</h2>
    <p><strong>SwiftData:</strong> All your data will be stored locally on your device. You can delete all data when you delete your account.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can use Ephemeriaâ€™s core features without a subscription.</li>
      <li>Your email is stored only if you choose to sign in.</li>
      <li>Subscription data is handled anonymously through RevenueCat.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain authentication and purchase data as long as it's needed to provide app functionality or meet legal obligations. Since RevenueCat uses anonymous identifiers, we cannot delete individual purchase records. Firebase-stored identity data (e.g., email/username) can be deleted upon request.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be reflected here, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:<br><a href="mailto:olivier.codes@gmail.com">olivier.codes@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p>By using Ephemeria, you agree to the collection and use of information as described above.</p>
